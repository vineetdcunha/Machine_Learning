# Machine_Learning
Machine learning models. Building own models as well as using scikit learn

KNN_without_scikit - Without scikit functions creating own KNN classifer. Parameter input to use various distance methods.

Data_Analysis_Predictive_Modeling_Census_data - Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling on Census data. Scikit-learn to build classifiers usinng Naive Bayes (Gaussian), decision tree (using "gini" as selection criteria), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)

Classification_using_scikit-learn - Classification using scikit-learn. Various classifiers provided as part of the scikit-learn (sklearn) machine learning module, as well as with some of its preprocessing and model evaluation capabilities
