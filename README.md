# Machine_Learning
Machine learning models. Building own models as well as using scikit learn

Data_preprocessing_analysis - General characteristics of the data as a whole: examine the means, standard deviations, and other statistics associated with the numerical attributes and distributions of values associated with categorical attributes.

KNN_without_scikit - Without scikit functions creating own KNN classifer. Parameter input to use various distance methods.

Data_analysis_Predictive_modeling_Census_data - Data Analysis and Predictive Modeling on Census data. Scikit-learn to build classifiers usinng Naive Bayes (Gaussian), decision tree (using "gini" as selection criteria), and linear discriminant analysis (LDA)

Classification_using_scikit-learn - Classification using scikit-learn. Various classifiers provided as part of the scikit-learn (sklearn) machine learning module, as well as with some of its preprocessing and model evaluation capabilities

Multiple_linear_regression - Experiment with multiple linear regression models to make predictions with numerical data. Exploring more systematic methods for feature selection and for optimizing model parameters (model selection).

Automatic_document_clustering - Using Pandas and other modules from scikit-learn for preprocessing or evaluation. Perform clustering on the documents and comparing the clusters to the actual categories.

Item_based_Recommendation - Using both standard item-based collaborative filtering (based on the rating prediction function "standEst") and the SVD-based version of the item-based CF (using "svdEst" as the prediction engine) to generate these recommendations for the users.

PCA_and_Clustering - PCA to reduce dimensionality and noise in the data. Comapring the results of clustering the data with and without PCA.
